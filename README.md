### Hi there, I'm Vu Pham 👋

I'm a web developer based in Vietnam. I enjoy building web applications using .NET Core, Angular, and TypeScript. I'm also interested in system design, design patterns, and learning about new technologies.

I've lauched my blog at [varundef](https://www.varundef.com) 

🔭 I’m currently working on building scalable web applications using Angular and .NET Core.

🌱 I’m currently learning about cloud technologies like Azure and AWS.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to web development.

💬 Ask me about Angular, .NET Core, TypeScript, or anything related to web development!
